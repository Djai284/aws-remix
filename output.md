## Recommended Remediations Based on AWS Well-Architected Framework

### Security

*   **WAFR Focus Areas:**  Identity and Access Management (IAM), Data Protection, Incident Response.

*   **Remediations:**
    *   **IAM User Review:**  Review IAM users such as `data-datapipeline-prod`, `data-prod`, etc. to ensure the access they have is justified and they follow the principle of least privilege. Ensure multi-factor authentication (MFA) is enabled for all IAM users, especially those with console access.
    *   **S3 Bucket Public Access:** The report data indicates most S3 buckets have appropriate public access blocks enabled. However, one S3 bucket, `loki-chunks-prodtabeks-076812642930-us-west-2`, was unable to retrieve it's PublicAccessBlock. This should be investigated immediately.
    *   **S3 Bucket Keys:** Review and enable S3 Bucket Keys for all S3 buckets that are storing large quantities of data. Even though SSE is in place, this is an additional cost optimization feature that can lower KMS costs for large data sets. Consider rotating the KMS keys periodically.
    *   **EC2 Security Groups:** Review the security group `eks-cluster-sg-prod-3449687` associated with the EC2 instances in `us-east-2` to verify if the ingress and egress rules are defined with principle of least privilege.
    *  **Encryption Enforcement:** Ensure encryption is enforced across all storage services using KMS CMKs, especially for sensitive data.

### Reliability

*   **WAFR Focus Areas:**  Foundations, Change Management, Failure Management.

*   **Remediations:**
    *   **EC2 Instance Types:**  The report indicates the use of "Old Generation" EC2 instances (t2.medium) in `us-east-2` .  It is crucial to migrate these instances to the newer generation instance types (e.g., t3, t4, t7).  This improves availability due to newer hardware and more recent software updates. Also the EC2 instance types have been flagged to include 'Reliability'. This likely means there are single points of failure. Look at using Availability Zones for resilience, and consider using managed services in some cases.
    *   **EBS Volume Types:** The report data shows that the EC2 instances utilize `gp2` EBS volume types by default in `us-east-2`, yet use `gp3` in `us-west-2`. Standardize on `gp3` for improved performance and cost.
    *   **Backup Strategy:** Verify and ensure automated backups are enabled for RDS instances. Confirm the backup retention policy aligns with RTO/RPO requirements.
    *   **Disaster Recovery:**  Implement disaster recovery strategies, such as using AWS Backup to centrally manage backups across multiple AWS services and regions.
    *   **Monitor Volume Utilization:** Many EC2 instances, including the `m7a.2xlarge`, are connected to EBS volumes with limited read operations and large write operations. Determine if these EBS volumes are correctly sized, or can be reduced for cost savings. Also consider using Elastic Volumes to dynamically adjust disk capacity without downtime.

### Performance Efficiency

*   **WAFR Focus Areas:**  Selection, Review, Monitoring, Tradeoffs.

*   **Remediations:**
    *   **EC2 Instance Right-Sizing:** The utilization metrics for EC2 instances in `us-east-2` and `us-west-2` show relatively low CPU utilization in some cases. Investigate right-sizing these instances to smaller instance types for cost optimization or migrate workloads to spot instances.
    *   **EBS Volume Optimization:**  Ensure EBS volumes are correctly provisioned for IOPS and throughput. Consider `gp3` or `io2` if the application requires higher performance levels, especially on database volumes.
    *   **Auto-Scaling Configuration:**  Ensure Auto Scaling groups are configured correctly to scale based on CPU utilization or other relevant metrics to meet performance demands efficiently, in response to incoming traffic.

### Cost Optimization

*   **WAFR Focus Areas:**  Expenditure Awareness, Demand Management, Resource Utilization, Efficiency.

*   **Remediations:**
    *   **EC2 Instance Purchasing Options:** For the running EC2 instances in `us-east-2` and `us-west-2`, explore purchasing options such as Reserved Instances or Savings Plans to reduce costs, especially for instances with consistent usage patterns.
    *   **Stopped EC2 Instances:** There are stopped `t2.micro` and `r7a.large` instances in `us-west-2` . Determine whether these instances are required. If not, consider terminating them.
    *   **S3 Storage Tiering:** Review S3 buckets for opportunities to use lifecycle policies to move infrequently accessed data to lower-cost storage tiers (e.g., S3 Intelligent-Tiering, S3 Glacier).
    *   **Unused Volumes:** Determine if any EC2 instances connected to EBS volumes that are not in use are required. If not, delete the unattached EBS volumes.
    *   **Region Optimization:** Explore the possibility of migrating some workloads from the more expensive `us-west-2` region to the less expensive `us-east-2` region, where possible, based on latency requirements.
    *  ** EBS Volume type** Ensure a consistent strategy of using gp3 EBS Volumes to manage and reduce unnecessary storage cost.

### Operational Excellence

*   **WAFR Focus Areas:**  Prepare, Operate, Evolve.

*   **Remediations:**
    *   **IAM Role and Policy Review:** Periodically review IAM roles and policies, particularly long-standing service roles like `AWSServiceRoleFor*`, and custom admin roles, to ensure that they are still relevant and adhere to the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Automation:**  Further leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using CloudFormation or Terraform for consistent and repeatable deployments.
    *   **Monitoring:** Improve monitoring and alerting on key performance indicators (KPIs) across all AWS services.
    *   **Patching:** Ensure automation of Patching processes, to minimize service disruptions and ensure systems meet security benchmarks.
    *   **VPC Flow Logs**: Ensure logging is enabled to monitor all VPC traffic to identify and troubleshoot connectivity issues.
